MPLAB Harmony device drivers (usually referred to as &quot;drivers&quot;) provide simple, highly abstracted C-language interfaces to peripherals and other resources. A driver's interface allows applications and other client modules to easily interact with the peripheral it controls using consistent usage models. Some functions are similar on all drivers, while other functions are unique to a particular type of driver or peripheral. However, driver interface functions are generally independent of the details of how a given peripheral is implemented on any specific hardware or of how many instances of that peripheral exist in a given system.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
Drivers normally utilize MPLAB Harmony Peripheral Libraries (PLIBs) to access and control peripheral hardware that is built into the processor (and is directly addressable by it). However, drivers can also support external peripheral hardware by calling another driver that directly controls a built-in peripheral to which the external peripheral is connected. For example, an SD Card driver may use a SPI driver to access its external SD Card Flash device. A driver may even be completely abstracted away from any hardware (utilizing no peripheral hardware at all), simply controlling some software resource (such as a buffer queue) or providing some service (such as data formatting or encryption). Using this method, driver and other modules may be &quot;stacked&quot; into layers of software, with each responsible for the details of managing its own resources while hiding those details from client modules that use them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
Regardless of the type of peripheral or resource that a MPLAB Harmony driver manages, a driver has the following fundamental responsibilities:
<ul class="Element635">
<li class="Element605">Provide a common system-level interface to the resource</li>
<li class="Element605">Provide a highly abstracted file system style client interface to the resource</li>
<li class="Element605">Manage the state of the peripheral or resource</li>
<li class="Element605">Manage access to the resource</li>
</ul>A driver’s system interface can be thought of as being a horizontal interface and its client interface can be thought of as being a vertical interface, as shown in the following block diagram. </p><p class="Element10" style="text-align: center;">
<img src="DRV COMMON Vertical Interface.png" border="0" alt="" title=""></p><p class="Element10">
The horizontal or &quot;system&quot; interface provides functions to initialize the driver and keep it running. To keep a driver running, a system loop or ISR function (but never both in the same system) calls its state machine &quot;tasks&quot; function repeatedly, as necessary. Therefore, a driver’s system interface is normally only called by code that is generated by the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC) when you select and configure the driver. Its purpose is to ensure that the driver works independently (conceptually in the background), providing the capabilities it implements. By contrast, the application (or any other &quot;client&quot; of the driver) normally only interacts with the driver’s vertical &quot;client&quot; interface (often thought of as the driver’s API). The client interface provides functions to open the driver for use and interact with it, reading or writing data or performing device-type specific operations. The client interface is what allows the application to access the peripheral in a safe and easy way without worrying about the details of the driver or what other clients it may be serving.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The following sections describe in general terms how to use these two interfaces and give specific examples to help illustrate the concepts. The subsequent help sections for each individual driver describe their specific interfaces in detail; listing all supported functions, parameters, and return values as well as their data types and expected behavior. You may also refer to the MPLAB Harmony Driver Development guide for additional information on MPLAB Harmony drivers and for information on how to develop your own drivers, if needed.</p></div>
