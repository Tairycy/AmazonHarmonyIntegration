For this configuration, the display has an on-board OTM2202a display controller. The PIC32MX uses a 16-bit parallel interface to initialize and communicate to the display peripheral. The aria_quickstart application uses the Graphics Library to render graphics to the display. As the Graphics Library draws the widgets and images, it uses the OTM2202a display controller driver APIs to write to the OTM2202a internal graphics RAM. </p><div class="Element63">

For these configurations, the display is driven by a SSD1963 display controller (located on the underside of the PIC32MK GP Development Kit board) that interfaces to the PIC32MK MCU through the PMP. The MCU-SSD1963 interface consists of 16 PMP data pins (PMP0-15), Read Strobe pin, Write Strobe pin, Data/Command_Bar pin, and Chip_Select_Bar pin. The PMP peripheral is driven by PMP peripheral library calls. As the Graphics Library draws the widgets and images, the Graphics Library uses the SSD1963 display controller driver APIs to command pixel and rectangle draws. The SSD1963 interfaces to the display through a 50-pin ribbon cable. This interface has 24 lines for RGB color, pixel clock line, vertical and horizontal sync lines, and a data enable line.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The application also features user touch input through the integrated touch screen on the display panel. Touch input from the touch controller goes through the I2C port, and the Input System Service acquires the touch input information from the touch and I2C drivers. The Input System Service sends touch events to the Graphics Library, which processes these events and updates the frame data accordingly. The MCU is alerted to touch events by the low assertion of the MAXTouch_Change event pin. This triggers a change notification ISR on the MCU, which then queues a read request to the touch driver. </p><p class="Element10" style="text-align: center;">

The application is condensed to 256 colors. Each color is presented as an 8-bit index value in the Look-Up Table (LUT). The LUT is created using the Global Palette feature within Harmony Graphics Composer. Each of these 256 colors is RGB888 (24-bit color). Because of this arrangement, a frame buffer requires 384000 bytes of memory (800 wide x 480 height x 1 byte per pixel).
